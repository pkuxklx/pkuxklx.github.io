- **Special Orthogonal, Special Unitary, and Symplectic Groups as Products of Grassmannians**  
  Research Assistant & Master's Thesis. [Paper](../files/prodGr12.pdf).  
  **Time**: Mar 2024 - Present  
  **Advisor**: Prof. [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/), Prof. [Ke Ye](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~keyk)  
  - This project is about decomposing the special orthogonal group SO(n), the special unitary group SU(n), and the symplectic group Sp(2n) into the product of Grassmannains. Here the Grassmannians are characterized by the [involution model](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/work/simpler.pdf).
  - We showed that SO(n) is a product of two real Grassmannians, SU(n) a product of four complex Grassmannians, and Sp(2n) a product of four symplectic Grassmannians.
  - My contribution is mainly on the decomposition of SU(n) into four Grassmannians. I characterized such decompositions and proved their uniqueness.

- **Graph Neural Networks in Canonical Correlation Analysis**  
  Research Assistant.  
  **Time**: Jul 2024 - Present  
  **Advisor**: Prof. [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/)  
  - Designed the GNN-CCA model, using GNN as the nonlinear mapping in Deep CCA. Developed linear-time evaluation algorithms for computations, as well as a stochastic training framework.
  - Tested our model on the UCI handwritten digits clustering and the Twitter friend recommendation tasks.
  - Neural Tangent Kernels

- **High-Dimensional Covariance Matrix Estimation with Auxiliary Network Information**  
  Research Assistant. [Paper](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/d129df61-ef70-48bb-978c-a7326510e02f) (acknowledged for contributions).  
  **Advisor**: Prof. [Shaoran Li](https://lishaoran.com/)
  - Proposed a generalized class of bandable covariance matrices. It uses the ordering of the correlation coefficients as a proxy for spatial distance, which allows for a more general network structure.
  - Designed the Network Guided Thresholding framework and the Network Guided Banding framework.
  - Proved the estimators' rate of convergence under operator norm  and Frobenius norm.
 
- **Multiple Imputation from an Algorithmic Perspective**  
  **Advisor**: Prof. [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/)
