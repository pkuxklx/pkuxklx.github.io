- **High-Dimensional Covariance Matrix Estimation with Auxiliary Network Information**  
  Research Assistant. [Paper](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/d129df61-ef70-48bb-978c-a7326510e02f) (acknowledged for contributions to the theoretical section).  
  **Advisor**: Prof. [Shaoran Li](https://lishaoran.com/)
  - Proposed a generalized class of bandable covariance matrices. It uses the ordering of the correlation coefficients as a proxy for spatial distance, which allows for a more general network structure.
  - Designed the Network Guided Thresholding framework and the Network Guided Banding framework.
  - Proved the estimators' rate of convergence under operator norm $\|\cdot\|_2$ and Frobenius norm $\|\cdot\|_F$.
â€¢ Conducted numerical simulations and compared error rates with nonlinear shrinkage and thresholding estimators.
