I'm a second-year master student in the School of Statistics, the University of Chicago. [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html). 
I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/) and Prof. [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/).
My research interest includes AI for drug discovery, LLM in bioscience and applying machine learning in biology.
