Hi! :wave: My name is Xiang Lu (陆翔), a second-year master student in the School of Statistics, the University of Chicago. 
I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/) and Prof. [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/). 
Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degreee from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. [Shaoran Li](https://lishaoran.com/).

Research Interests
=====
My current research lies primarily in the computational and statistical problems related to matrices and complex data structures. 
I'm also broadly interested in topics such as high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing.
